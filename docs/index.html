<hr />
<p>I am a creator, builder and fixer, forging highly capable and effective teams while bringing ideas to life with technology. Over the span of my 20+ years, starting in Silicon Valley, through to Microsoft Canada, and Benevity, I’ve learned that success often depends as much on having the skills to find, grow, and coach the right people, as it does on having the best architecture and a solid implementation. I would love to bring that insight to your products and your team culture.</p>
