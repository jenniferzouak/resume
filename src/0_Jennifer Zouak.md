I am a creator, builder, and fixer of software. I forge highly capable and effective teams while bringing new ideas to life. Over the span of my career, from Silicon Valley, through to Microsoft in Toronto, and then Benevity here in Calgary, Iâ€™ve learned that success depends equally on having on the skills to find, grow, and coach the people, as  having the fit-for-purpose architecture and a maintainable implementation.
