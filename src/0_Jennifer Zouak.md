I am a builder and fixer, forging highly capable and effective teams while bringing ideas to life with technology. Over the span of my 20+ years, starting in Silicon Valley, through to Microsoft Canada, and Benevity, Iâ€™ve learned that success often depends as much on having the skills to find, grow, and coach the right people, as it does on having the best architecture and a solid implementation. I would love to bring that insight to your products and your team culture.
