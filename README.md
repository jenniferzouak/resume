I am a creator, builder, and fixer of software. I forge highly capable and effective teams while bringing new ideas to life. Over the span of my career, from Silicon Valley, through to Microsoft in Toronto, and then Benevity here in Calgary, I’ve learned that success depends equally on having on the skills to find, grow, and coach the people, as  having the fit-for-purpose architecture and a maintainable implementation.

## KEY ACHIEVEMENTS

- Design and launched (GTM) a new SaaS product line at Benevity, directly contributing to an annual direct recurring revenue (ARR) of $750K and indirect revenue around $5 million by the second year, which represented an infinity% increase over previous years due to my strategic marketing, enablement, re-pricing, and customer adoption strategies.
- Doubled the customer (B2C) conversion rate at PlayDreamscape from 8% to 15% within 4 months by implementing a strategic overhaul of the pricing model, purchase experience, and tuning the funnel based on cohort measurements of conversions.
- Ranked as the top leader in the annual P&C survey at Benevity, ranking 1st out of approx. 120 other leaders, reflecting exceptional leadership in team engagement and strategic project execution which contributed to a team which was recognized as top for productivity.
